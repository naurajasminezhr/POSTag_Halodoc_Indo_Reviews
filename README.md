# POS Tagging Analysis of HaloDoc Reviews

This project performs Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on HaloDoc app reviews to analyze user feedback and sentiment.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Preprocess and clean HaloDoc app review data
2. Perform POS tagging on the cleaned text
3. Analyze the distribution of POS tags
4. Identify top entities and their frequencies

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `src/`: Source code for utility functions
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Data Files

1. `word_pos_tags.csv`: Contains individual words and their POS tags
2. `top_pos_entities.csv`: Lists the most frequent entities and their POS tags
3. `pos_tags_summary_2.csv`: Provides a summary of POS tag distributions
4. `pos_tags_all_summary.csv`: Offers a comprehensive summary of all POS tags

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory

## Key Findings

- Most common POS tags in reviews
- Frequently mentioned entities
